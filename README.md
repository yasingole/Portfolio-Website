Cloud Resume Challenge

Project Description

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a practical project designed to showcase your expertise in cloud computing, automation, and continuous deployment. The challenge involves building and deploying a personal resume website using cloud technologies, with a focus on AWS services and Terraform for infrastructure as code.

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to cloud engineering, covering front-end development, cloud hosting, infrastructure automation, and CI/CD practices.

Challenge Components

1. HTML/CSS/JavaScript
Resume Website: Develop a static resume website using HTML and CSS. Optionally, enhance it with JavaScript for interactivity.
Version Control: Store the source code in a public GitHub repository.
2. Cloud Hosting
AWS S3: Deploy the static website to an Amazon S3 bucket configured for static website hosting.
AWS CloudFront: Use AWS CloudFront to distribute the website content globally with low latency.
DNS Configuration: Link a custom domain to your CloudFront distribution using Amazon Route 53.
3. Infrastructure as Code
Terraform: Use Terraform to define and provision all necessary cloud resources, ensuring a consistent and repeatable infrastructure setup.
Version Control: Include your Terraform scripts in the same GitHub repository as your website code.
4. CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your website whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
Testing: Integrate basic testing into the CI/CD pipeline, such as HTML validation or linting.
